# Security Policy

## Introduction

This project is committed to maintaining a high level of security. We encourage all contributors to follow security best practices when submitting code, and we ask that you report any security vulnerabilities to us promptly. 

## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you discover a security vulnerability, please follow these steps to report it:

1. **Do not open a public issue** – If you find a security vulnerability, please send an email to **security@yourcompany.com**.
2. **Provide a detailed description** of the vulnerability and any necessary steps to reproduce it.
3. We will investigate the issue and work with you to ensure it is resolved. We will also keep you updated on the progress.

## Secure Coding Practices

To ensure the security of the codebase, all contributors are required to adhere to the following secure coding practices:

### 1. **Input Validation**
   - Always validate user inputs to ensure they meet the expected format.
   - Use a whitelist approach for validating input (allow only known good values).
   - For sensitive inputs, such as passwords, use strong validation patterns (e.g., minimum length, complexity requirements).

### 2. **Data Protection**
   - Encrypt sensitive data both at rest and in transit. Use strong encryption standards (e.g., AES-256 for encryption).
   - Never store passwords in plain text. Always hash passwords using a secure hashing algorithm (e.g., bcrypt, scrypt, or Argon2).

### 3. **Error Handling**
   - Avoid exposing stack traces or other sensitive information in production environments.
   - Log errors securely and ensure they do not contain any sensitive data such as passwords or personally identifiable information (PII).

### 4. **Authentication and Authorization**
   - Use multi-factor authentication (MFA) for access to sensitive areas of the system.
   - Ensure that users only have access to resources they are authorized to access. Implement role-based access control (RBAC) where applicable.

### 5. **Dependencies and Libraries**
   - Regularly update dependencies and libraries to their latest stable versions.
   - Use tools such as **OWASP Dependency-Check** to identify known vulnerabilities in dependencies.

### 6. **Code Review Process**
   - Ensure that all code changes are reviewed by at least one other developer before merging.
   - Include security checks as part of the code review checklist.

### 7. **Use Secure APIs**
   - Always use HTTPS for communications with external APIs to prevent man-in-the-middle attacks.
   - If your code integrates with third-party services, ensure that you follow the third-party’s security guidelines.

## Static Application Security Testing (SAST) with Semgrep

We use **Semgrep** for Static Application Security Testing (SAST) to ensure our code is free of common security vulnerabilities. The following checks are run as part of the CI/CD pipeline:

- **Injection Vulnerabilities:** Detect SQL injection, OS command injection, and other injection flaws.
- **Authentication Issues:** Look for improper authentication mechanisms.
- **Cryptography Weaknesses:** Check for weak or outdated cryptographic algorithms.
- **Sensitive Data Exposure:** Identify improper handling of sensitive data.

To run Semgrep locally, follow these steps:

1. **Install Semgrep:**

   ```bash
   pip install semgrep
   ```

2. **Run Semgrep:**

   ```bash
   semgrep --config=auto .
   ```

   This will scan the current directory (`.`) for potential security issues using Semgrep's predefined rule set.

### Semgrep Rules and Configuration

- All pull requests must pass the Semgrep security checks before they are merged.
- Any findings from Semgrep will be reviewed and triaged as needed.
- We encourage contributors to run Semgrep locally before submitting code.

## Best Practices for Contribution

- Ensure all pull requests adhere to the code style guidelines.
- Perform local testing for security vulnerabilities before submitting.
- Consider security implications when introducing new features.

## Security Updates

- We will release security updates when vulnerabilities are discovered and patched.
- Users and contributors will be notified promptly about critical security patches.
